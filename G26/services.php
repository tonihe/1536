	<h2>Web Design and <span>Development</span></h2>
	<p>
	Here at Web RCKT Design, we take development and design seriously, no seriously.<br><br>
	Just because one design works well with one business doesn't mean that it will have the same effect with another. Our team of developers and graphic designers will work with you to build the presence that you want and you need.<br><br>
	We recently helped out Levels night club with this exact situation, you can read about their story <a href="projects/project2.php" class="serviceslinks">here</a>.

	A well designed website is nothing without the stories that it can tell and share. It is important to us that for your website, what really stands out is the amazing content that your company can bring to the table.<br><br>
	At Web RCKT, we have expert editors and designers who excel at taking your stories, and sharing them with the world.<br><br>
