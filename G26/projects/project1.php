	<h2>VanTravels:</h2>
	<p>
	VanTravels is the brainchild of Vancouver B.C native Jennifer Chen, who had the great idea of making travel affordable for all different kinds of people. Her modest startup was founded in 2010 and has since then growth to reach an international audience.<br><br>
	She reached out to us at Web RCKT Design to create a website that was both functional and simple for her many kinds of customers.

	<h2>Not all those who wander are lost</h2>
	<p>
	VanTravels emphasizes a "choose your own adventure" type packaging because Jennifer knows there's no one size fits all to traveling. From pre-existing packages, we provided a way for customers to customize their own trips like never before. Want to switch up your stay longer in one place and shorter in another? No problem VanTravels has you covered.

	<h2>Catch them on one of their networks...if you can.</h2>
	<p>
	VanTravels started as a modest travel newsletter subsription site, but has since then been transformed into a community of so much more. Nowadays, their social media page has garnered 800K likes across all channels and RCKT Design had to come up with a way for them to connect all their thoughts together.
