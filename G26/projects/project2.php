	<h2>Levels Club Website</h2>
	<p>
	Levels nightclub approached us in order to create an awesome website that would attract like-minded people from all over Vancouver.<br><br>
	We knew that in order to create that trademark nightclub vibe, we had to create a website that would show just how much fun it is to celebrate your semester ending at Levels.

	<h2>Seamless Reservations</h2>

	<h2>Be the First One to Know About Events</h2>
	<p>
	Levels really wanted the Upcoming Events feature to be a core component of their site, so we tried hard to make their feature instantly evident and appealing when you first go on their page.<br><br>
	Whether your favourite DJ is in town or you can't wait for the next topical party mixer, it should only take you seconds to figure out when's the next day to head down to Levels.
